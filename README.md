# Introduction
The first step in processing the data is organizing the raw data, the DICOM (.dcm) files, into an appropriate file structure so that a BIDS converter can be used on it. BIDS ([Brain Imaging Database Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)) is a standardized way to organize neuroimaging data, and is how programs like fmriprep need the data to be organized.
