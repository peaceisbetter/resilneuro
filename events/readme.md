readme file for the events subdirectory in the resiliency project

The purpose of this section is to take in psychopy output files and create event timing files for use in FSL

There are two scripts to start with, the make_events_tsv.R and the make_events_tsv_FSL.R scripts. They are named badly.

First run through make_events_tsv.R
Then run through make_events_tsv_FSL.R
